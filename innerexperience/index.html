						<h1>Increase interpersonal effectiveness</h1>
						<p>
							For adolescents struggling with academic pressure and social demands.
						</p>
						<p>Participating in these groups can be used as an adjunct to the teen’s individual treatment or as a step down from an inpatient or IOP level of care. In some cases participation in group might be appropriate as the sole psychotherapeutic intervention.
						</p>
						<div class="outer-box-work">
							<p>The style of these psychotherapy groups is interpersonally oriented, using Mindfulness and CBT skills. 
								We focus on individual goals while growing self-awareness and interpersonal effectiveness.
								Participants gain insight into their relationship styles and explore and increase their self-efficacy.
							</p>
						</div>
						<p class="big">
							Goals: 
							- Increased ability to handle stressful situations 
							- Staying mindful in the midst of anxiety 
							- Better understand one's own automatic reactions and learn to find new, healthier coping skills
							Benefits: 
							In a group environment you can work out your personal psychological issues in the safety of the therapeutic environment among your peers 
							Transition from the lessons you learn from the therapeutic interventions will be easier to translate to real life than from individual therapy 
							If you also attend individual sessions, this modality will enhance the effectiveness or serve as a bumper zone between the therapy setting and  real life 
							The group environment facilitates utilization of skills learned from group as well as individual therapy

			<h1>Approach to therapy</h1>
			<p>
				People seek the help of a psychotherapist when they are in distress or emotional pain. We are all faced with various degrees of stress throughout our life and we handle these in various ways. Sometimes we are more successful with it, sometimes less so. The role of psychotherapy is to help the person through these hardships in life and potentially help gain something useful from the experience rather than just surviving it.
			</p>
			<p>
				My approach to psychotherapy comes from the psychodynamic orientation and I bring in my own style, my previous experiences and understanding of human behaviors.
			</p>
			<p>I work with people on their anxieties and worries that manifest in many areas of life – mental, emotional, or physical complaints. These layers all influence each other and long lasting relief will come if we explore the underlying cause to the turmoil on all levels. For those with family issues, we also explore family dynamics – parents with extra stresses to their own career and personal growth, and adolescents finding their own individual expression. Working with a holistic approach is satisfying for the individual and provides interpersonal relief. My approach to therapy is psychodynamic, being curious about effective and meaningful ways to heal one's painful experiences while also looking for ways to open up more space for meaning and creativity in one's life. I take pride in creating a safe space so these explorations could emerge.</p>

			<h1>Policies</h1>
			<p>I am currently accepting new patients in my psychotherapy private practice located in Los Altos.</p>
			<p>Address: 851 Fremont Ave, suite 107, Los Altos, CA 94024</p>
			<p>Populations served: Adolescents and adults are welcome - individuals and groups</p>
			<p>Availability: My practice is open to new individual patients. If you are interested in participating in group therapy or support groups please inquire about the availability and beginning of the next group session.</p>
			<p>Initial contact: Please contact me at (650) 814-2697 or email ildiko@innerexperience.com to schedule an initial consultation where you can share with me what you are looking for and you can get a glimpse into what I have to offer. If you are interested in working with me but you are uncertain how it would feel to be in ongoing therapy, I recommend that you come for three to five sessions and then we discuss if we consider our cooperation a good match.</p>
			<p>While an initial phone call is a useful way to establish contact, I usually recommend that we meet in person to talk and discuss all your questions. This way, in a face-to-face conversation, while we exchange important information and practical details you will also get a general sense that will help you make the decision.</p>
			<p>I encourage you to take the next step and give therapy a chance.</p>
