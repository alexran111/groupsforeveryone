			<h1>Conjoint group therapy approach</h1>
			<p>I believe that offering our clients a combined approach to psychotherapy is best practice. Most people greatly benefit from attending group sessions to incorporate their new insights about themselves and practice  new behaviors that individual therapy has opened up for them. Working cooperatively we can support our clients to make best use of the services we offer. I would like to encourage you to contact me if you have individual clients whom you consider a good candidate for groups. I would also be happy to hear about the groups you are running as I might have individual clients for whom I am looking for an appropriate group outside of my practice.</p>

You may have moved here from a different country or state, and are lacking your previous support system from your multi-generational family members and life-long friends. This group is aimed to share and mourn that loss and find new meaning in connecting with others, as you create a new life for yourselves and your families. We will look at both sides of the coin: verbalizing the loss, which is so often unspoken and discouraged, but also celebrating the potential and strength that we carry, as we nurture and create a life for ourselves in this new culture where we need to be flexible yet grounded.
